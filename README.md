The course surveys key design consideratoins of Cloud Computing and common components of [__Amazon Web Services__](http://aws.amazon.com/). Four programming projects include implementing Map-Reduce, interacting with AWS  components such as EC2, ELB, and DynamoDB using official Java API, and creating Hadoop job that interacts with HBase.
